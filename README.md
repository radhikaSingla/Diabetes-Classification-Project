# Diabetes Classification Project

## Overview

This project predicts whether a patient has diabetes using multiple machine learning classification algorithms. The objective was to compare model performance and identify the best predictive model.

## Workflow

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation Heatmap Visualization
- Outlier Detection using IQR
- Feature Scaling
- Train-Test Split
- Model Training and Evaluation

## Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Results

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 82.09% |
| SVM | 82.09% |
| Random Forest | 77.61% |
| Gradient Boosting | 73.13% |

Logistic Regression and SVM achieved the highest accuracy of 82.09%.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion

Among all tested models, Logistic Regression and SVM provided the best performance for diabetes prediction on this dataset.
